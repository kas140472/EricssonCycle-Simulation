#### 1. Focus Area : Reinforce theoretical concept, Experimentation

<u>About the Experiment:</u><br>
The ideal Ericsson cycle is a reversible thermodynamic cycle. It differs from the Carnot cycle in that the two isentropic processes are replaced by two constant-pressure regeneration processes.

The idealized Ericsson cycle consists of four thermodynamic processes acting on the working fluid:
1-2 Isothermal compression.
2-3 Constant pressure regeneration (internal heat transfer from the working fluid to the regenerator)
3-4 Isothermal expansion.
4-1 Constant pressure regeneration (internal heat transfer from the regenerator back to the working fluid)

In this experiment, the Ericsson cycle is demonstrated so that the user can understand how the P-V graph changes as various pressure and volume parameters change. The heat addition, heat rejection, net work output, as well as efficiency of the cycle is calculated and displayed.

<u> <b>Description:</b></u> <u> Instructional Strategy will be implemented in the simulator as follows: </u>
<br>
The experiment consists of the Ericsson cycle P-V graph. The variable panel contains sliders for the pressures P1 and P3 and the volumes V1 and V3. The setup consists of a graph that depicts the Ericsson cycle. A legend at the top indicates the processes involved in each of the curves. By changing the various parameters, the P-V graph changes.

1. The initial value of P1 (pressure at the beginning of the isothermal compression process) is taken as 3 kPa.
2. The initial value of P3 (pressure at the beginning of the isothermal expansion process) is taken as 8 kPa.
3. The initial value of v1 (volume at the beginning of the isothermal compression process) is taken as 9 m<sup>3</sup>/kg.
4. The initial value of v3 (volume at the beginning of the isothermal expansion process) is taken as 7 m<sup>3</sup>/kg.
5. P1 can be varied from 3 to 4 kPa using slider, up/down arrow or entering the value of P1.
6. P3 is varied from 8 to 11 kPa using slider, up/down arrow or entering the value of P3.
