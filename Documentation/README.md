<h5> About the Lab (Objective) : </h5>

The main objective of this lab is to demonstrate the change in P-v graph of Ericsson Cycle, as the pressure and volume variables change, as well as calculate and display the heat addition, heat rejection, net work output, and efficiency of the Ericsson cycle.

<h5> About the Experiment : </h5>

The ideal Ericsson cycle is a reversible thermodynamic cycle. It differs from the Carnot cycle in that the two isentropic processes are replaced by two constant-pressure regeneration processes.
<br><br>
The idealized Ericsson cycle consists of four thermodynamic processes acting on the working fluid:<br>
<li>Isothermal compression.</li>
<li>Constant pressure regeneration (internal heat transfer from the working fluid to the regenerator).</li>
<li>Isothermal expansion.</li>
<li>Constant pressure regeneration (internal heat transfer from the regenerator back to the working fluid).</li>
<br>
In this experiment, we demonstrate the change in P-v graph of Ericsson Cycle, as the pressure and volume variables change. The heat addition, heat rejection, net work output, as well as efficiency of the cycle is calculated and displayed.
